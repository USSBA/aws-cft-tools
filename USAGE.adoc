# Using `aws-cft`

## Deploy

```
aws-cft deploy [OPTIONS]
```

Ensure stacks in AWS are up to date with the templates in the repository. This will create any missing
stacks.

### Options

`-e`, `--environment ENVIRONMENT` ::
set environment on which to operate

`-r`, `--role ROLE` ::
add a role filter

`-j`, `--jobs INTEGER` ::
maximum number of parallel stacks to build simultaneously (default: 1)

`-c`, `--[no-]check` ::
only do non-destructive operations to check validity of request

`-f`, `--file FILE` ::
set configuration file relative to the project root (default: ".aws_cft")

`-n`, `--[no-]noop` ::
only do operations that do not require modifying AWS

`-p`, `--profile PROFILE` ::
set profile (default: "default")

`-R`, `--region REGION` ::
set AWS region (default: "us-east-1")

`-t`, `--root DIRECTORY` ::
set infrastructure project root

`-T`, `--tag NAME:VALUE` ::
require a tag have the given value (may be given more than once)

`-v`, `--[no-]verbose` ::
verbose narration of actions

`--version` ::
Show version

`-h`, `--help` ::
print help

### Notes

Stacks are built or updated in dependency order. If a template imports the outputs of another template,
then the importing template will not be updated or created until after the exporting template is
updated or created.

When restricting the deployed templates to those with a particular role, the list of selected templates
is expanded to include any templates on which the set of selected templates depend. For example, if
template A has the role we wish to deploy, but it depends on template B, and template B depends on
template C, then templates A, B, and C will be selected for updating or creating.

**N.B.:** Using the `-j` option to deploy templates in parallel can cause the script to run into request
limits in AWS. If AWS does refuse a request because of throttling, the script will exit with an error.
Try running it again with a lower number of simultaneous jobs.

**N.B.:** If you interrupt the script while it is deploying templates (without the `-c` or `-n` options),
then none of the changes will be rolled back. Any stacks in-progress will continue to completion since
the script only watches for completion once the build has been triggered.

**N.B.** If you interrupt the script while it is checking on changesets (the `-c` option), then none of the
changesets that are in-progress will be removed. You may have some "orphan" changesets to clean up by hand.

#### Recommended Deployment Strategy

When preparing to deploy new or updated templates, you can get an idea of what will happen by running
the `deploy` command in the following sequence (replace `[OPTIONS]` with the options you need to manage
select the right profile, environment, and/or roles):

`aws-cft deploy [OPTIONS] -v -n` ::
Review the proposed list of templates and make sure they are being updated or created as expected.

`aws-cft deploy [OPTIONS] -v -c` ::
Review the proposed list of changes for each stack and make sure there are no surprise replacements or deletions.

`aws-cft deploy [OPTIONS] -v` ::
Finally, execute the deployment and make the changes to the templates.

### Examples

List templates to be updated/created in dependency order using the `lower` AWS credentials in the
`us-east-1` region, but don't make any changes in AWS:

```shell
% aws-cft deploy -p lower -t ~/Code/infrastructure -R us-east-1 -v -n
```

## Diff

```
aws-cft diff [OPTIONS]
```

Report on templates with no corresponding stack, stacks with no corresponding template, and the
differences between the template source if the template has a corresponding stack.

### Notes

The `-t` or `--root` option specifies the directory to be initialized. This defaults to the current
directory in which the command is run. The `-f` or `--file` option specifies the name of the configuration
file, which defaults to `.aws_cft`.

This command creates the following directory and file structure:

* cloudformation/
** parameters/
*** applications/
*** data-resources/
*** data-services/
*** networks/
*** security/
*** vpcs/
** templates/
*** applications/
*** data-resources/
*** data-services/
*** networks/
*** security/
*** vpcs/
* .aws_cft

## Retract

```
aws-cft retract [OPTIONS]
```

Remove stacks matching a set of templates. This will not remove stacks that are known dependencies for
stacks that are not marked for retraction.

### Options

`-e`, `--environment ENVIRONMENT` ::
set environment on which to operate

`-r`, `--role ROLE` ::
add a role filter

`-c`, `--[no-]check` ::
only do non-destructive operations to check validity of request

`-f`, `--file FILE` ::
set configuration file relative to the project root (default: ".aws_cft")

`-n`, `--[no-]noop` ::
only do operations that do not require modifying AWS

`-p`, `--profile PROFILE` ::
set profile (default: "default")

`-R`, `--region REGION` ::
set AWS region (default: "us-east-1")

`-t`, `--root DIRECTORY` ::
set infrastructure project root

`-T`, `--tag NAME:VALUE` ::
require a tag have the given value (may be given more than once)

`-v`, `--[no-]verbose` ::
verbose narration of actions

`--version` ::
Show version

`-h`, `--help` ::
print help

### Notes

Stacks are removed in reverse dependency order. If a template imports the outputs of another template,
then the importing template will be removed before the exporting template is removed.

When restricting retracted templates to those with a particular role, the list of selected templates
is reduced by any templates on which non-selected templates depend. For example, if templates A and B have
the role we wish to retract, and template C depends on template B, then only template A will be selected
for retraction.
